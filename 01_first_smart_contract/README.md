# First Smart Contract
This folder contains all the information needed for creating your first smart contract. 

# Main Components
1) Smart Contract - This is code which defines the logic of what we want to do.
2) EVM Node - node connected to ethereum virtual machine which deploys our code to the test/main network.
3) UI Application - Application which interacts with the smart contract and uses wallet to identify us.


# Technologies
Some of the tools that we will be using for creating our first smart contract are
1) Solidity - It's a computer language that helps write smart contracts
2) Hardhat - It's a build tool that makes smart contract development very easy by proving us with 
   tooling for compiling, building and deploying the smart contract. Doing each of these tasks manually can 
   can take hours
3) TypeScript(+ JavaScript) - Typed language that makes writing JavaScript code very easy
4) React - Most famous UI framework used for adding UI applications that run in the browser
5) Ethers.js - JavaScript library which helps us interact with smart contracts
